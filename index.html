        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Halit, a Computer Science graduate (BS) from the University of the People with a deep passion for networking and cybersecurity. 
            Beyond my degree, I have pursued multiple industry-recognized certifications to strengthen my expertise and demonstrate 
            my commitment to the field. My career goal is to become a Network Engineer or SOC Analyst, and I am currently seeking an entry-level 
            role as an IT Support Analyst or NOC Engineer to gain practical experience. With a strong foundation in networking concepts and a relentless 
            drive to grow, I am eager to apply my skills in a professional setting and contribute to a forward-thinking team.
